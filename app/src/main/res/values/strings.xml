    <string name="bio">My name is Florencia and I\'m 22 years old. I\'m finishing the Computer Engineering program.\n\n
        When I was 19, I started to work as intern at Core Security (now it\'s Secureauth). Since then I haven\'t stopped learning and improving in the computer field.
        \n\nOutside of work, I like watching series and movies on Netflix and Disney +. Sometimes, I go out with my friends to have fun, we like playing board games.\n
        Also, when I have free time, I spend time on taking courses to learn new technologies. I strongly recommend websites such as Udemy, Codecademy and Udacity.\n\n
        I\'m a big fan of travelling. My boyfriend and I have visited many places in our country - Argentina -, but we\'d like to dive into the whole world.
